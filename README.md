Air quality is a growing public health concern in fast developing and urbanising communities, contributing to about 7 million deaths globally every year. In Ghana, some estimates hold that poor air quality contributes to 17000 deaths per year. It is also recognized as one of the fastest rising causes of ill health. Unfortunately because poor air quality is often invisible, its danger to our wellbeing could be missed. Monitoring and sharing information about air pollution in an area over time could help governments, community groups, and citizens identify ‘trouble spots’ and collaboratively work out solutions to improve local air quality.  

This event is held as an activity for the Africa Science Week in partnership with the Next Einstein Forum, Global Labs and Workshed.
